# AI Agents to play Argentinian “Truco” card game

Truco is a popular trick-taking card game in South America.
We worked on the Argentinian 2-player version of it and
we made some simplifications to develop an agent capable of
playing it in a rational way. The goal of this project was to create
a Minimax (with Alpha-Beta pruning) and a RL agent that
were (at a minimum) able to perform better than a player that
just takes random actions. We were able to accomplish this
goal and have laid the groundwork for future work by providing
a game implementation and environment on a game that
has had very little development in this area.
